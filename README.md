# Predicting ICU LOS Using ED Data

This project will attempt to predict intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) using emergency department (ED) data for patients admitted to an ICU from the ED. We will be using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database, a relational database comprised of deidentified electronic health records (EHRs) for patients admitted to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA, USA. We will be using the `icu` and the `ed` modules. 

Here is the [link to the report](Report.md) for this assignment.
